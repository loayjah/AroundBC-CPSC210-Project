# My Personal Project: Around British Columbia

## Background

This was my final project of CPSC210 (Software Construction), where we used Java to build a cross-platform GUI desktop application using the Swing library. I have learned and implemented various concepts in this project, such as Data Abstraction and Code Testing using JUnit5. I have also performed best practices of object-oriented construction and design: Hierarchy and Associations, Bi-Directional Relationships, Cohesion and Coupling, Liskov Substitution Principle.

The idea of the application is a tourism guide for residents and visitors of British Columbia to help in planning their trips based on their available time. It will suggest various of places to go, and provide a complete unforgettable trip. The user can determine their free time, some expectations of the trip (number of things to do, distance/range, trip type), and other more filtration. I like this idea because I am new to BC and would love to explore places in the province.
